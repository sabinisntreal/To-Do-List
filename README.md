# Task Management App

This is a simple task management application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add tasks by entering text into the input box and pressing the "Add" button.
- **Remove Task:** Users can remove tasks by clicking on the delete button (represented by a "×") next to each task.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task itself. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after the browser is closed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a task in the input box and press the "Add" button.
4. To mark a task as completed, click on the task itself.
5. To remove a task, click on the delete button (represented by a "×") next to the task.
6. Tasks are saved locally, so they will persist even after closing the browser.

## Customization

You can customize the app by:

- **Styling:** Modify the CSS styles within the `<style>` tags in the HTML file to change the appearance of the app.
- **Functionality:** Add additional features or modify existing functionality to suit your needs.
